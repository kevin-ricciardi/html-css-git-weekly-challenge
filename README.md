# HTML, CSS, and Git Weekly Challenge

## Summary

The goal of this repository is to store an improved version of the code provided for the web application for the the company Horiseon. The site serves as the home page to introduce users to the company and to the unique services that the company provides. This includes sections regarding "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and Social Media Marketing". There are also sections describing specific benefits that the organization offers to clients. These include the sections titled "Lead Generation", "Brand Awareness", and "Cost Management". This current code provides improvements from its previous iteration that aim to present the application in a way that is more similar to the desired appearance.

## Changes/Improvements 

The following changes were made in the HTML and CSS files for the application:

* In the **HTML** document, the footer section on lines 74 to 79 has been removed to better resemble the image representing the desired application appearance (01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png).
* In the **CSS** document, the original background color of the header for the web application is the same as the background color for the sections for "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing". However, the desired application appearance seems to show a different shade of blue for the color of the header compared to the other sections. To consolidate this, the background color for the header on line 14 has been changed from 0072bb to 31698b.
* In the **CSS** document, the margin bottom of the section ".benefit-cost" on line 100 has been tripled from 32 pixels to 96 pixels to better resemble the desired application appearance.
* In the **CSS** document, the footer section on lines 191 to 200 has been removed to coincide with the removal of the footer section in the **HTML** document.
